      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m currently pursuing a degree in BSCS at University of Cabuyao, where I’ve developed a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning. I work part-time at Lazada, where I assist in the sorting process for e-commerce. This experience has sharpened my organizational skills and provided insights into the fast-paced online retail world. I'm excited to build my future in tech! My hobbies include reading, hiking, and exploring new places.</p>
